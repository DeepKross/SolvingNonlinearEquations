# SolvingNonlinearEquations
It`s a program that solves nonlinear equations of (Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D = 0) type. <br>
For using this program you need to take some actions of your own and to check some theorems before. <br>
Firstly enter A B C D parametrs. Then choose precision epsylon for solving equations. After it choose method. Enter [1] for bisection method. Enter [2] for Newton method and [3] for simple iteration method. <br>
-For Dividing in half or Bisection method:<br>
---Find the interval where equation has a root. Take a and b as left and right sides of this interval and check condition f(a) * f(b) < 0 <br>
---If this function is monotonous we will find the root.<br>
-For the Newthon method:<br>
---Enter initial guess x0.<br>
-For Simple iteration methodL <br>
---Set initial aproach x0
---Insert A,B,C,D in the (Ax^2 + Bx + C)^1/3 function.
